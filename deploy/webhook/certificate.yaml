# # OPTIONAL: Certificate resource for cert-manager

# # NOTE: This file is OPTIONAL. Self-signed certificates are the default and recommended approach.
# # Use this only if you have cert-manager installed and prefer managed certificates.

# # For most deployments, use the self-signed certificate approach:
# #   ./generate-certs.sh
# #   or
# #   make generate-certs

# apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
# kind: Certificate
# metadata:
#   name: kubechronicle-webhook-tls
#   namespace: kubechronicle
# spec:
#   secretName: kubechronicle-webhook-tls
#   issuerRef:
#     name: kubechronicle-selfsigned-issuer
#     kind: ClusterIssuer
#   dnsNames:
#   - kubechronicle-webhook.kubechronicle.svc
#   - kubechronicle-webhook.kubechronicle.svc.cluster.local

# # Self-signed ClusterIssuer for development/testing
# # For production, use a proper CA issuer
